## Projects

A curated selection of **academic, research, and professional projects** showcasing expertise in  
**full-stack software development, artificial intelligence, geospatial data systems, computer vision, and cybersecurity**.  
These works bridge computer-science research with practical engineering applications.

---

### Public Projects

- **[BRACANA SVET - Security Validation and Educational Tool](#bracana-svet)**  
  A full-stack API security framework developed in **Laravel + Docker**, integrating **OWASP ZAP**, **Nikto**, and **Semgrep** (with **CodeQL** planned).  
  Automates static and dynamic vulnerability scanning, classifies findings according to **OWASP Top-10 categories**, and delivers **AI-generated remediation guidance** via the OpenAI API.  
  Validated on deliberately vulnerable environments (Flask, SvelteKit, DVWA) to ensure accurate detection of **XSS, SQL injection, and authentication flaws**.  

- **[Pothole Detection CV](#pothole-detection-cv)**  
  A classical **computer-vision pipeline** for **road-surface distress detection**, implemented using **OpenCV** techniques such as edge detection, contour extraction,  
  and morphological filtering. Built for infrastructure inspection and pavement-condition analysis using open roadway imagery datasets.  
  The repository contains the **traditional CV-based version** of the project; an extended **YOLO-based deep-learning model** is currently under development and will be released separately.

- **[AI Patrol Optimizer](#ai-patrol-optimizer)**  
  Predictive-analytics platform for **law-enforcement patrol optimization**.  
  Utilizes **Gradient Boosting** and **Random Forest** models to forecast high-risk areas and compute optimal routes through the **Google Maps API**.  
  Enhances public-safety resource allocation with a data-driven, geospatially aware decision process.

- **[Rently - Rental Management Platform](#rently-rental-management-platform)**  
  A modern, role-aware rental-management platform created by **Nacim Elias**.  
  I am an **authorized collaborator and active contributor**, responsible for building the **entire frontend implementation** using **React, TypeScript, Vite, and Shadcn UI**.  
  My work includes authentication flows, UI architecture, dashboard components, and integration-ready interfaces designed for future backend expansion.  
  The project is actively evolving sprint-by-sprint with clean modular design, coding standards, and traceability to the SDD and SCM plan.

- **[T.H.R.E.A.T. - Tactical Hazard Recognition and Evaluation for Agent Safety](#threat-tactical-hazard-recognition-and-evaluation-for-agent-safety)**  
  AI-driven safety system developed during **UTEP Hackathon 2025** to analyze high-risk domestic-violence situations before officers arrive.  
  Integrates autonomous drones, **YOLOv8**, **AWS Rekognition**, **OpenAI LLMs + TTS**, and **n8n orchestration** for real-time situational awareness.  
  Originally a hackathon prototype, now transitioning into a **cloud-ready implementation** with scalable, secure API pipelines.

## Private / Restricted Projects

> The following projects remain closed-source due to **institutional ownership**, **academic confidentiality**, or **security policies**.

- **[PRF - Project Request Form System](#prf-project-request-form-system)**  
  Internal Laravel-based platform for project submission and approval workflows.  
  Developed using **Laravel (Blade, JavaScript, HTML, CSS)** and **MySQL**, replacing a legacy Access system.  
  Features URL normalization middleware, input validation, and streamlined backend logic for stable multi-user performance.  
  Designed for maintainability and long-term institutional deployment. Used by El Paso Metropolitan Organization (City of El Paso).

- **[MWT - Multimodal Web Tool](#mwt-multimodal-web-tool)**  
  A **Laravel GIS web application** for the **El Paso Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO)**, integrating **Google Maps API** for visualizing multimodal transportation performance measures.  
  Implements a **complete geospatial data pipeline** - from **data preprocessing in GeoPandas**, through **database structuring and backend logic**, to **frontend visualization** -  
  ensuring spatial precision, visual clarity, and operational efficiency.  
  Portal: https://myctis.utep.edu/mpo/mwt/

- **[Crack Propagation Analysis - ML + CV Framework](#crack-propagation-analysis)**  
  Research platform designed around the Texas (TxDOT) Overlay Test to model asphalt crack propagation dynamics in laboratory-tested specimens by fusing synchronized left and right videos with per-frame deformation (CSV) data, aligning visual events to the experimental timeline so crack initiation, growth rate, and cumulative crack length can be quantified; it combines computer-vision tracking (strain/feature fields, heatmaps, and crack-path extraction) with machine-learning regression to estimate crack-growth trajectories, detect early-stage propagation trends, and enable predictive materials research through integrated visual, temporal, and test-condition signals, with reproducible exports and reporting for each specimen and replicate.

- **[INFILTR8 (Academic / Senior Project)](#infiltr8-academic--senior-project)**  
  Capstone system built with **SvelteKit**, **FastAPI**, and **Neo4j**, emphasizing graph-based data modeling, modular authentication, and collaborative data handling.  
  Contributed backend logic, API integration, and authentication workflows within a multidisciplinary team.  
  (Restricted - academic and security constraints.)
